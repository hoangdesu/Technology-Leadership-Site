My name is Hoang Nguyen. I'm currently a Software Engineer major at RMIT University Vietnam. Welcome to my blog about Technology Leadership.

According to Januszewski and Molenda (2008), cited in Brown (2009), technological leadership is defined as the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using, and managing appropriate technological processes and resources.

With the help of technology, leaders can view the number of tasks accomplished by team members in real-time. It also helps them communicate any change in the tasks they are doing no matter where they are. It has brought a good amount of change in the way leaders communicate and deal with their employees.
